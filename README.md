# Waste Categorization 
This project takes images as input and then categorizes them into "organic, inorganic, plastic, recycle" class labels.

# Inspiration
*Here in India, waste segregation is one of the most tedious process. Implementing such Machine Learning model that has the capacity to categorize different products into their respecitve class labels will give an efficient way to manage waste.*


# Output

# What further can be done 
- A more efficient algorithm can be devised, that gives higher accuracy and takes less training time than CNN.
- The resultant model can be implemented into autonomous waste segregation plants
